## Installation

StructuredQueries.jl is registered in [METADATA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl). Install it with

```
julia> Pkg.add("StructuredQueries")
```

This package supports Julia 0.5.


## Objectives

The present package aims to support a querying framework that is

* Generic -- the framework should be able to support multiple backends.

* Modular -- the framework should encourage modularity of collection machinery.

* Extensible -- the framework should be easily extensible to represent (relatively) arbitrary manipulations.

* Ergonomic -- the framework should allow users to express their intentions easily.


## Documentation

... Is currently offline, since I just (as of 11/16/16) redesigned much of this package. Documentation will catch up in December, once this academic quarter is over.
